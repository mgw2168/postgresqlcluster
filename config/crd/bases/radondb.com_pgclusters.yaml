                  instances \n A long note on memory limits. \n  We want to avoid
                  the OOM killer coming for the PostgreSQL process or any of their
                  backends per lots of guidance from the PostgreSQL documentation.
                  Based on Kubernetes' behavior with limits, the best thing is to
                  not set them. However, if they ever do set, we suggest that you
                  have Request == Limit to get the Guaranteed QoS \n Guaranteed QoS
                  prevents a backend from being first in line to be killed if the
                  *Node* has memory pressure, but if there is, say a runaway client
                  backend that causes the *Pod* to exceed its memory limit, a backend
                  can still be killed by the OOM killer, which is not great. \n As
                  such, given the choice, the preference is for the Pod to be evicted
                  and have a failover event, vs. having an individual client backend
                  killed and causing potential \"bad things.\" \n For more info on
